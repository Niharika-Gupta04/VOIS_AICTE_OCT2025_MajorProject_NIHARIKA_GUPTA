# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis

This project presents an in-depth analysis of Netflix’s movie and TV show dataset using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The goal is to uncover insights about content trends, genres, release patterns, and more through data visualization and exploration.

## 📊 Project Overview

The Netflix dataset contains information such as titles, directors, cast, release years, countries, ratings, and genres. By performing data cleaning, visualization, and pattern discovery, this notebook helps us understand:

* What type of content dominates Netflix (Movies vs TV Shows)
* Which countries produce the most Netflix content
* The most common genres and release trends over the years
* Popular ratings and audience categories

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python** – Core programming language
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive data analysis
* **Pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation
* **NumPy** – Numerical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization and trend plotting

## 🚀 Features

* Data preprocessing and null value handling
* Interactive visualizations revealing content distribution
* Year-wise and genre-based analysis
* Insights into Netflix’s global content strategy

## 💡 Insights

Some interesting findings from the analysis:

* Movies form a larger part of Netflix’s library compared to TV shows.
* The United States leads in content production, followed by India and the UK.
* Drama, Comedy, and Documentary are among the top genres.
* Most shows are rated for mature audiences (TV-MA).

## 🧩 How to Run

1. Install Python and Jupyter Notebook
2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
